# Sherlock-and-Array-JS
Find an element of the array such that the sum of all elements to the left is equal to the sum of all elements to the right

#Example:-
 arr = [5, 6, 8, 11]
 
 8 is between two subarrays that sum to 11

You will be given arrays of integers and must determine whether there is an element that meets the criterion. If there is, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.
